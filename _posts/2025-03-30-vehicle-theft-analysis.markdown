This project looks at vehicle theft in San Francisco from 2003 to 2024. The goal is to help the San Francisco Police Department better understand when and where these crimes happen, and to find ways to reduce them even more. We start by looking at theft patterns by the hour of the day, then identify which districts have higher theft rates. Finally, we use a map to highlight specific areas and streets where theft is more common.

A sharp drop in thefts after 2005 is likely due to the introduction of engine immobilizer systems in newer cars. This shows how technology can help reduce crime â€” and with better data, we can aim for even greater improvements.

## Hourly Crime Rate by Year

The average crime rate is indicated for each year. The blue bars represent hours that exceed the average.

It looks like the hourly pattern is recurring every year as the number of vehicle theft crimes is increasing throughout the day. The above plot shows us the significant difference in vehicle theft crime by the hours. This allows us to better understand when these crimes are likely to occur. The blue bars represent hours that exceeded the hourly average per year. This is valuable, as SFPD can allocate more officers in those sensitive hours.
